"# Mtn.Library.Standard" 
Project Description
.NET library with extensions for LINQ and Entity Framework as well as useful extensions.
Contains many extensions, features for display methods using jquery Ajax.
Has a proxy to create and use methods with cache as much as in the ajax methods.

The MTN Library is an evolution of my old library (since 1999 in c to C # today) and inspired by some other libraries, like commonlibrary and others. 
With the main inspiration and some ideas from the Tesla Library, that is a commercial library which I had the pleasure to work. 
This library has grouped many ideas scattered before in various libraries in a single library, centralizing several utilities which I thought was valuable and inspired me to reassemble my libraries and inspired me to add some of the ideas to my library with my vision and my personal touch ;-).

To be a source of study for some trainees work with me on my team and to facilitate understanding for students , I began to exercise my knowledge to create a library with these ideals and to provide through an open source license, in this case the MIT license .

Each features I've seen in other libraries and I copied for this library is documented with their respected authors, like the Json.Net (which is an excellent work, among others). 
I believe is no sense to redo what was done well and is open source just like this library, so feel good in do the same and add some of my codes in their library.
No code and / or commercial library was and / or will be used in this library, all the code that exists or is it original or have the names of authors (and was copied from code where possessed the same kind of open source licensing).

*********************************************

After a few years using (and testing) with many partners (also friends) decided to publish a new version of Mtn.Library.
The real reason for this delay is the documentation, this year I finished, but I was convinced by friends and partners to publish and then go documenting throughout the year.
There are still adjustments to make before that, but rode a blog only for this documentation http://lib.metanoianet.com/.
The library was made much before the Web Api but still useful, mainly due to the cache and debug it provides, besides setting up the ajax code (which is always the same) in jQuery (default). Among other points need to set a medium trust problem (Marcello swear I have not forgotten about you) and check some statistics points I need to improve beyond the cached database that I owe already longer than it should, but I think it can put here again motivate me to evolve further the library, especially if there is much use and people need these features.
Much of what is in it today is also due to backwards compatibility to not impact the various projects going with her.
Anyway, I hope you like and send bugs and suggestions. And who wants to help with the documentation, do not be shy, be very welcome :-).
